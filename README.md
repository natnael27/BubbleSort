# BUBBLE SORT
Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

In this Python code, the bubble sort function takes an array as input and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm. 
The example usage at the end initializes an array, prints the original array, performs bubble sort, and then prints the sorted array.
